# Release Configuration

TODO: Add more description

## Branches

- main: used to release the latest (stable) verion
- dev: used for keep work in progress. Every PR should target this branch. We would release a stable version every x (to be defined) weeks through the main branch. Changes in this branch are released under the `-dev` tag on npm.
- next: used for any next major iteration (e.g big API change or performance imrpovements)
